Shelly Cloud is an ultra fast Platform-as-a-Service with exceptional support, a complete professional hosting solution for those who want to save their time, effort, money and sleep well at night.</p></div><div class="grid__item two-thirds palm--one-whole lap--one-half text-center"><a href="http://shellycloud.com"><img srcset="images/project/shelly-6781b4d7.png 1x, images/project/shelly-2x-658f7af5.png 2x" src="images/project/shelly-6781b4d7.png" /></a></div></div><hr class="rule" /><div class="grid"><div class="grid__item one-third palm--one-whole lap--one-half text-justified"><h4><a class="link-clean" href="http://bookingsync.com">BookingSync</a></h4><p>BookingSync solves the problem of renting rooms or entire properties from owner perspective.

This data is used to present users with flights of their choice and otherwise remains unused. However it is a source of valuable business intelligence - it just needs to be properly summarized.</p>

<p>We have built a separate service based on Goliath that handles data collection and statistics. We have based our solution on map&#x2F;reduce pattern. Results are collected as fast as possible and dumped to filesystem. Their processing is queued up using Resque&#x2F;Redis. Response time is a steady 1ms, way below our limit.</p>

<p>Each result needs to be processed and intelligence data needs to be extracted from it. It takes 300ms for each Resque worker to extract necessary information. As this is done in background it doesn&#x27;t impact overall application performance and when necessary can be scaled to multiple computing nodes without a problem.</p></div><div class="grid__item two-thirds palm--one-whole lap--one-half text-center"><a href="http://tripsta.com"><img srcset="images/project/tripsta-9e8e7535.png 1x, images/project/tripsta-2x-88f603b0.png 2x" src="images/project/tripsta-9e8e7535.png" /></a></div></div><hr class="rule" /><div class="grid"><div class="grid__item one-third palm--one-whole lap--one-half text-justified"><h4><a class="link-clean" href="https://www.locafox.de">Locafox</a></h4><p>Imagine the situation that you need to buy something in your city.
